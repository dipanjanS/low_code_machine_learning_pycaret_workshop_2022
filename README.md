This workshop was done as a part of the 1729 conference organized by Fractal Analytics and Analytics Vidhya. Key content covered was hands-on notebooks leveraging PyCaret to compare, build, tune, evaluate and interpret machine learning models.

## Session Outline

Low-code and Auto-ML are essential tools in a data scientistâ€™s toolbox to improve productivity and iterate faster in data science projects. This hands-on workshop will focus on two major notebooks:

- __A Kickstarter notebook__ leveraging the popular open-source library PyCaret and go through learning the essentials:
    - Setup experiments
    - Train ML models
    - Compare ML models
    - Tune ML models
    - Evaluate models 
    - Predictions on new data.

- __An advanced notebook__ where we learn advanced capabilities of PyCaret including the following:
    - Data transformations
    - Imputation
    - Multicollinearity
    - Handling imbalanced data
    - Advanced tuning methods
    - Ensembling (Bagging, Boosting, Stacking, Blending) 
    - Explainable AI to interpret ML Models.

__Recommendation:__ Please open the notebooks in Google Colab
